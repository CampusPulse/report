<p>Welcome to the CampusPulse Reporting System</p>

<p>This page will eventually contain documentation on how to use this site to direct people towards filling out ServiceNow Tickets. This page is (in most cases) not meant to be directly viewed unless you want to know how to implement this reporting process in your system</p>



<h2>Reporting pages available</h2>

<h3>button.html (<a href="{{ "/button.html" | relative_url }}">link</a></h3>

<!-- talk about how this page needs to be used with room= in the url -->

<p>This page is used to report broken door buttons. It is used in conjunction with the room= parameter in the URL to prefill the room number in the form.</p>
