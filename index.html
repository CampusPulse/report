<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Welcome to the CampusPulse Reporting System</p>

<p>This page is intended to act as documentation on how to use this site to direct people towards filling out ServiceNow Tickets. This page is (in most cases) not meant to be directly viewed unless you want to know how to implement this reporting process in your system</p>

<h2>Reporting methods</h2>

<p>There are a few reporting methods this site aims to support:</p>

<h3>1. Automatic Form filling</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Pending RIT integration</p>
<p>This method enables this site to pre-fill most or all of the information in RIT's Helpdesk forms for you by redirecting you to the RIT helpdesk with some additional data in the URL</p>

<h3>2. Assisted Form Filling</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Available</p>
<p>This method simplifies the process of reporting to RIT's Helpdesk somewhat by providing you a link to the correct helpdesk form as well as suggested values for you to copy-paste into the form</p>

<!-- <h3>3. Email</h3>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Coming Soon</p>
<p>This method simplifies the process of reporting issues to RIT when the preferred method to recieve reports is via email. This method can generate a link that will open your email client with the correct address, subject line, and contents pre-filled</p> -->



<h2>Reporting pages available</h2>

<h3>button.html (<a href="{{ "/button.html" | relative_url }}">link</a></h3>

<!-- talk about how this page needs to be used with room= in the url -->

<p>This page is used to report broken door buttons. It is used in conjunction with the room= parameter in the URL to prefill the room number in the form.</p>
